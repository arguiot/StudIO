# Using Git
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

> TLDR; Git is a tool that tracks your files within StudIO over time.

In git terms, a project is called a `repository` (so you will see this word quite often in this documentation or in the StudIO app).

### Creating a repository
Please refer to the “Create a project” section.

### Tracking changes / commit
When you want to freeze the state of a file (basically save a specific version of a file), you need to tell Git to do so. Doing a such action is called a `commit`. Commits should have a name or a small description so you can remember which is which. They also can contain multiple files.

So let’s say you where working on your project and you added a cool new feature to it.
