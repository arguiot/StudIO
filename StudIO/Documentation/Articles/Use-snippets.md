# Use snippets
Snippets are great! They can make your development experience even better by shortening things you write multiple times (ex: for creating HTML templates)

And StudIO handles snippets just as you would expect: smoothly and nicely.

To start using snippets, you firstly need to create them: either by importing them, generating them or hard code them.

### Access the snippet menu

In the editor interface, there is an icon representing a small board with an arrow, tap on it. You should now see a popover window with an empty list (if you have no snipopets of course) and a few options at the top.

Now, you have two options:
- create / import your snippet (+ icon)
- use smart answer (search icon)

Tap on the desired icon at the top of the popover and fill the form accordingly. Then, to save the snippet, just tap `Done` or `OK` at the top.
