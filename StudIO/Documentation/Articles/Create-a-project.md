# Create a project
You want to start using StudIO, but you have no idea what to do? One of the very first things you will do before using StudIO is to create a project.

*But what is a project?*

You can see a project as a folder or a directory where you can store all of your code / files. All project will also act as a local git repository, so you can create commits.

## Create a local project

The simplest way to start is by creating an empty local project. To do so, when you're on the launch screen, just tap on the **+** icon in the upper right corner of your screen.

You should now see an action sheet that ask you wether you want to **Clone a repository** or **Start a local repository**

Just tap on **Start a local repository**.

Then, just name your project and you should be done: your project should appear in the project list.

# Clone a remote project

Usually, when you want you work on something, the project is already created (either by you or someone else). And so you might want to clone this project. To do so, when you're on the launch screen, just tap on the **+** icon in the upper right corner of your screen.

You should now see an action sheet that ask you wether you want to **Clone a repository** or **Start a local repository**

This time, select **Clone a repository**

Then, please specify your repositoryâ€™s URL (and the credentials if the project is private). Just wait a bit, and you should be done: your project should appear in the project list.
