# Using the Completion Bar
When you edit your source code, a bar will automatically show up on top of your keyboard. This bar was designed to help you get the most out of StudIO. The bar can be splitted into 2 sections:
- Smart completion (the bulb icon)
- Quick text shortcuts

## Smart Completion & Preview

On the left of the bar, you can see a grey bulb icon. When you tap on it, the bar will change appearence. Thus a text field should appear with a button on the right to activate the preview (available for HTML, Markdown and LaTeX). 

Similar to snippets, you can (in most languages) type in the bar a question in natural language (a bit like on Google, DuckDuckGo, ...) and StudIO will work out the solution to your problem. Please note however that this feature is only available with internet (StudIO uses online resources), but no data is stored on our servers. You can try by typing `for loop` or `load an image from a server`

That said, when you edit an HTML file, the smart completion bar will use Emmet to help you. You can try this by typing `.test>img+h1{This is a test}`.

## Quick text shortcuts
These shortcuts are very easy to use. They are present automatically and help you while you code. They can be customized with plugins. There are 2 types: static and dynamic. The first type will always be present and will not change. While the second type will adapt itself according to what you are writing.
