# StudIO
**The first extensible code editor on iOS**

> Find out more: https://studiocode.app

StudIO is an iOS app that simulates the same complete development environment that you have on macOS or Ubuntu (or other \*nix OS) machine. It primarily focuses on iPad, but it does work perfectly fine on any iPhone.

# Contribute
As StudIO was made open source due to an internal decision, we encourage everyone to contribute. If you're a Swift developer, that's awesome and this section might not be super useful, as you'll quickly become familiar with the project architecture.

But if you don't know how to code, you can improve StudIO's internal documentation ([`./StudIO/Documentation/Articles/`](https://github.com/arguiot/StudIO/tree/master/StudIO/Documentation/Articles)).

Or, if you know JavaScript or TypeScript, we'll need your help for the editor that you can find [here](https://github.com/arguiot/StudIO/tree/master/cmLib) and [there](https://github.com/arguiot/StudIO/tree/master/StudIO/Editor/CodeMirror/EditorView).
